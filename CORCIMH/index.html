    	<h2>About</h2>
<br/>
    	<p>
<p>The main manuscript of the first part of the General e Grand Estoria is Mss 816, a codex called by the acronym A, which is kept in the National Library of Spain (BNE). The exact date of this copy is unknown, since it lacks a colophon, but it could be dated to 1275.</p>

<p>The text is a well-preserved parchment codex. It has 342 folios, arranged in 43 quaternions of 8 folios (except one of 6), with catchwords, and follows the Gregory’s rule, by which the flesh sides and the hair sides are respectively faced. It presents three cover pages at the beginning and at the end. The folios reach an approximate size of 410 x 292 mm. The foliation is modern, perhaps of the eighteenth century, and presents a couple of errors: after folio 25 the next one was ignored, which is now 25 bis; the numbering of folio 312 was omitted.</p>

<p>The text shows a very careful librarian gothic writing made by several hands, although it contains some errors and corrections. It presents a double column layout, with 41 lines each one. It has a discreet ornamentation in blue and red, colors also used for enlarged capital letters. The titles of the chapters appear in red.</p>
