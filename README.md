## Synopsis

This is the front end of The Confluence of Religious Cultures in
Medieval Historiography: A Digital Humanities Project. It uses Bootstrap 3. The Confluence project uses digital humanities methods to better understand the interaction between different cultural and religious communities within Medieval Iberia, as part of ongoing studies of the historically specific relationship between religion and culture. This project is generating contemporary intercultural, interreligious, and interdisciplinary conversation and collaboration through the study of the confluence of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim biblical interpretation in Medieval Spain.
